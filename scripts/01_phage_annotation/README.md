# Scripts used for annotation of viral sequences in the 1,524 Pseudomonas genomes
# First VIBRANT_annotation.sh was run on the assembled genomes
# Then mash.sh was run on the VIBRANT output files *phages_combined.fna 
# Then the R scripts were run in this order:
# 01_optimal_clustering.R
# 02_clustering_to_clean_data.R
# 03_clustering_to_phylogeny.R
# to get Figures 1C and 1D
